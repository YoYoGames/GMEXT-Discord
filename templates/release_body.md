## DESCRIPTION

Looking to foster social connections and create a vibrant community around your game? Look no further than the Discord Game SDK. This powerful toolkit allows you to bring Discord's voice, video, and text chat right into your game, enabling players to communicate, coordinate, and share experiences without ever leaving your game environment. It also facilitates easier game invites and rich presence, letting your players' Discord friends see what game they're playing, which server they're on, or even their in-game status. By leveraging the Discord Game SDK, you can help make your game a truly social experience!

## FEATURES 

* **Rich Presence**: This feature enables players' statuses to be displayed on Discord, showing what game they're playing, their current in-game progress, or even specific game server details.

* **Overlay**: This feature allows players to access Discord's interface while in-game, meaning they can interact with their friends or community without alt-tabbing out of the game.

* **Activity Feed**: Developers can create updates or send notifications that will show up in the user's Discord activity feed, enhancing community engagement.
